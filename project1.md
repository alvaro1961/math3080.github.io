Use R to simulate the following:

1. Roll a dice 4 times and find the sum
1. Select 4 different numbers between 1 and 100. Find the maximum value, the minimum value, and the difference.
1. Roll 3 dice 100 times. Find how many times the sum of the dice is at least 10.
1. Permute the letters of the word SIMULATE 100 times and find out how many times the first letter is an S and the last letter is an E. That is, we are looking for words of the form S******E.
1. Repeat the previous problem but find out how many times the first letter is a vowel.
1. A box has 4 red balls and 6 blue balls.  Select 5 balls 10000 times and find out how many times we get exactly 3 red balls.
1. In a popular carnival game, players roll three dice. If at least one of them is a 6, they win $1; otherwise, they lose $1. They argue that this is a fair game. Each die has a 1/6 chance of being a 6, and the probability of having at least one 6 in three dice rolls is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2. Simulate the game in R. Play it 1000 times and find out how much money you won or lost.
